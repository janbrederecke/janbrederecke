### Hi my name is Jan and I am a data scientist working in cardiovascular epidemiology ðŸ‘‹.

I use GitHub to work on R packages and other things that need to be easily found and distributed online.

All R packages are still under construction and have not yet been published.

Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janbrederecke/).
